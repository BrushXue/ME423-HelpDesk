# What is the definition of H?

To avoid confusion, we're normalizing H based on the y-dimensional length, which means <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H=\frac{Mb}{k}">

If you use <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H=\frac{Ma}{k}">, please adjust your solution accordingly.

This normalization applies to both question (a) and (b).
